# General Questions

1. **What is a validator?**

   Validators propose and vote on blocks to include in the chain. The chain is secured by a staked amount of GNO. Validators stake GNO and receive additional GNO as rewards for correct behavior (proposing and attesting blocks) and a slashed balance as penalties for incorrect behavior (offline node, attesting invalid blocks).

2. **What is Shapella?**

   Shapella refers to the combination of both Shanghai and Capella. Shanghai enables GNO staking withdrawals for Gnosis Chain, unlike the previous model that doesn’t allow for staked GNO to be withdrawn. Shanghai is the name given to the execution layer (EL) upgrade, while Capella is the name of the coinciding consensus layer (CL) upgrade.
   
3. **What tax software has integrated GC?**

   [Cryptio](https://cryptio.co/) is available for German users. 

4. **I’m totally new to this project and I’m trying to feel myself around. Where should I start learning?**

   You can jump to all relevant links on our landing page at https://www.gnosis.io/. Alternatively, you can check our documentation https://docs.gnosischain.com/. Also, feel free to take a look at the governance forum to see what is being discussed around the community regarding improvement proposals https://forum.gnosis.io/.

5. **I have a problem with connect Safe <-> deposit.gnosischain.com since there is new walletconnect in UI. When will it be fixed?**

   Devs are currently working on it, currently a workaround is to use the wallet extension Rabby and import your Safe in it then to connect it to the page like if it was a Metamask wallet.

6. **Is Gnosis Chain a Testnet or Mainnet released?**

   Gnosis Chain is not a testnet. It is a fully operational Layer 1 utilizing Proof of Stake. But if you are wondering, Gnosis Chain has its testnet called Chiado, the details of which can be found here: https://docs.gnosischain.com/about/networks/chiado.
